            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Firſt, yee muſt prepare and make a great bed or quarter wel repleniſhed, blend or mixt with good fatte earth, and placed well in the Sunne, and to be well laboured and digged a good time before you doe occupie it: and if ye can by any meanes, let it be digged very deepe the winter before, in blending or mixing it well together with good fatte earth, or elſe to be mixed almoſt the halfe with good dung: and ſo let it rot and ripe together with the earth. And ſee alwayes that plot bee cleane unto the preſſing of Syder, that no wild Cions or Plants doe ſpring or grow theron. Then in the month of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, December</hi> or there-abouts, take of the Pepins, or Pomes of the ſaid fruit at the firſt preſſing out of your licour, before the Curnels be marred or bruſed: then take out of them and rub a few at once in a cloth, and dry them betwixt your hands, and take ſo many thereof as you ſhall thinke good: then make your bed ſquare, faire and plaine, and ſow your

This done, devide your beds into quadrants or ſquares, of foure foote broad or thereabout, that when ye liſt ye may clenſe them from the one ſide to the other, without treading theron. Then ſhall ye cover your Seeds, or Pepins with fine earth, ſo ſifting all over them, that then they may take the deeper and farer roote, and will keepe them the better in Winter following, and if ye liſt ye may rake them a little all over, ſo that ye raiſe not your Pepins aboue the earth.</p>

                        <p>THe ſecond manner to Graffe, is ſtrange enough to many: This kind of Graffing is on the tops of branches of Trees, which thing to make them grow lightly, is not ſo ſoone obtained: whereſoever they be grafted, they doe onely require a faire young wood, a great Cion or twig, growing higheſt in the Tree top, which Cions ye ſhall chooſe to graffe on, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorts of fruits if ye will, or as ye ſhall thinke good, which order followeth.</p>
                        <p>TAke grafts of other ſorts of Trees, which ye would graffe in the top thereof, then mount to the top of the tree which ye would graft, and cut off the tops of all ſuch branches, or as many as ye would graft on, and if they be greater then the grafts, which ye would graft, ye ſhall cut and graft them lower as ye doe the ſmall wild ſtocke aforeſaid. But if the Cions that you cut be as great as your graft that you graft on, ye ſhall cut them lower betwixt the old wood and the new, or a little more higher, or lower: then cleave a little, and chooſe your grafts in the like ſort, which ye would plant, whereof ye ſhall make the inciſion ſhort, with the barke on both ſides a like, and as thicke on the one ſide as the other, and ſet ſo juſt in the cleft, that the barke may be even and cloſe, aſwell above as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, on the one ſide as the other, and ſo bind him as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9346:25"/> It ſhall ſuffice that every graft have an oylet, or eye, or two at the moſt, without the joynt, for to leave them too long it ſhall not be good, and ye muſt dreſſe it with Clay and Moſſe, and bind it as it is aforeſaid. And likewiſe ye may graffe theſe, as ye doe the little wild Stocks, which ſhould be as great as your Graffes, and to graft them, as ye doe thoſe with Sappe like on both ſides, but then you muſt graffe them in the earth, as three fingers of, or there-abouts.</p>

For a good Tree planted, or ſet well at large, it profiteth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more of fruit then three or foure Trees, ſet too nigh together. The moſt greateſt and largeſt Trees commonly are Walnuts and Cheſnuts, if ye plant them ſeverally in ranke, as they doe commonly grow upon high wayes, beſides hedges and Fields, they muſt be ſet xxxv. foote aſunder, one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or there-abouts, but if ye will plant many rankes in one place together, ye muſt ſet them the ſpace of xiv. foot one from another, or thereabouts, and ſo farre ye muſt ſet your rankes one from another. For the Peare-trees and Apple-trees, and of other ſorts of Trees, which may be ſet of this largeneſſe one from the other, if ye doe plant onely in rankes by hedges in the Fields, or otherwiſe, it ſhall be ſufficient of xx. foote from another.

If ye liſt to ſet or plant all your Trees of one bigneſſe, as of young Trees like rods, being Peare-trees, or Apple-trees, they muſt be ſet a good ſpace one from another, as of twenty or thirty foote in

The third place ſheweth, how other ſome doe ſet out one Pole in the middeſt, and the Hop rootes at holes put in round about. The fourth place ſheweth, how ſome chops in a Spade croſſe in the top, and there layes in his rootes. The fifth place ſheweth, how ſome doe ſet foure Poles therein, and puts the Hop round about the Hill. The ſixth place ſheweth, that ſome uſe to make croſſe-holes in the ſides, and there layes in the Hop rootes. Thus many practiſes have beene proved good: Proved alwayes, that your Hills be of good fat earth, ſpecially in the middeſt downe unto the bottome.

                     <p>Vpon every Acre you may erect ſeaven, eight, or nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth hills, as hereafter ſhall be declared.</p>
                     <p>Vpon every hill well ordered, you ſhall have three pounds of Hops at the leaſt.</p>
                     <p>Two pounds and a halfe of theſe Hops will largely ſerve for the bruing of one quarter of Mault.</p>
                     <p>One hundreth pounds of theſe Hops, are commonly worth xxvi. ſhillens viii. pence. So as one Acre of Ground, and the third part of one mans labour, with ſmall coſt beſides, ſhall yeeld unto him that ordereth the ſame well, forty Markes yearely, and that for ever.</p>
                     <p>And here is to be noted, that ground orderly uſed, doth not onely yeeld the more, the greater, the harder, and the weightier Hops, but alſo they ſhall go further, they ſhall endure longer, they ſhall be holeſomer for the body, and pleaſanter of verdure or taſt, then ſuch as be diſorderly handled. And in the ſavour of the Hop thus much more I ſay, that whereas you cannot make above eight or nine gallons of indifferent Ale out of one buſhell of Mault, you may draw xviii. or xx. gallons of very good Beere, neither is the Hoppe more profitable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the quantity of your drinke, then neceſſary to prolong the continuance thereof For if your Ale may endure a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, your Beere through the benefit of the Hop ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a Moneth, and what grace it yeeldeth to the taſt, all men
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:9346:54"/> may judge that have ſence in their mouthes, and if the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie be betwixt Beere and Ale, which of them two ſhall have the place of preheminence: it ſufficeth for the glory and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Beere, that here in our owne country, Ale giveth place unto it, and that moſt part of our Countrymen doe abhorre and abandon Ale, as a lothſome drinke, whereas in other Nations Beere is of great eſtimation, and of ſtrangers entertained as their moiſt choice and delicate drinke Finally, that Ale which is moſt delicate and of beſt account, boroweth the Hoppe, as without the which it wanteth his chiefe grace and beſt verdure.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things conſidered, you may proceed to the making of your Garden, wherein you are yet to have counſell, for the laying out thereof, for the due ſeaſon and the right trade to cut and ſet Hoppe rootes, what choice ye ſhall make of them, what charge you ſhall be at for them, you are yet alſo to learn the time, when, and the way how to prepare your ground, and to make it able to entertaine and nouriſh them, to frame your hills, to maintaine them, and to pull them downe to cut, to faſhion, to erect, to pull up, and to preſerve your Poales, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to dry, and to pack your Hops, with many other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances neceſſarily appertaining hereunto. Finally, ye muſt be taught the reformation of many enormities and abuſes which are received in moſt places for good rules, the which (God willing) I will ſet forth truly according to the notes of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, although not learnedly after the Rules of Rhetoricke.</p>

                     <p>For the preſervation and better continuance of Poles, ſome make houſes of purpoſe, and lay them up therein.</p>
                     <p>Some ſet them upright to a Tree, and over them make a penthouſe of boughes or boords.</p>
                     <p>Some lay a great heape of Hopſtalkes upon the ground, and upon them a great heape of Poles, and upon the Poles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine lay another heape of ſtalkes, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Theſe men doe hereby expreſſe no great experience, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by their diligence they ſignifie a good deſire.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall need to doe no more but thus. At the ends or ſides of your Garden, take three Poles ſtanding upon three hills placed directly one by another, and three like Poles upon three other hills of the next row right over againſt them, conſtraine them to meet together by two and two in the tops, and ſo hold them till one with a forked wand may put three Withes (like unto three Broome bands, which may be made of the ſtalkes of Hops) upon each couple of the ſaid ſixe Poles, ſo ſhall the ſame ſixe Poles being ſo bound by two and two together, ſtand like the roofe or rafters of an houſe.</p>
                     <p>To keepe the Poles that ſhall lye nethermoſt from rotting, by the moyſtneſſe of the ground: within the compaſſe of your ſaid ſixe hills, (underneath the Poles that you have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened

                     <p>If you thinke that you have not Poles enough to fill the roome, pull downe the Withs or bands lower, and your roome will be leſſe, and this doe before you lay in your Poles.</p>

                     <p>Some thinke it impertinent and not neceſſary to make hills the firſt yeare, partly becauſe their diſtruſt of this yeares pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite quallifieth their diligence in this behalfe, and partly for that they thinke that the principall roote proſpereth beſt, when there be no new rootes of them forced and maintained. But experience confuteth both theſe conjectures, for by indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, the firſt yeares profit will be great, and thereby alſo the principall ſets much amended, as their proſperity in the ſecond yeare will plainely declare.</p>
                     <p>But in this worke you muſt be both painefull and curious, as wherein conſiſteth the hope of your gaines, and the ſucceſſe of your worke. For the greater in quantity you make your hills, the more in number you ſhall have of your Hops, and the fewer weeds you ſhall have on your ground, the more Hops you ſhall have upon your Poles.</p>
                     <p>In conſideration whereof I ſay, your labour muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall from this time almoſt till the time of gathering, in raiſing your hills and clearing ground from weeds.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt yeare that you plant your Hop garden, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe not one ſcience, but ſuffer them all to clime up to the Poles, for if you ſhould bury or cover all the ſprings of any one of your three rootes, which you did lately ſet, the roote thereof periſheth, and perhaps out of ſome one roote there
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:9346:61"/> will not proceed above one or two ſprings, which being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, that roote I ſay dyeth, and therefore the more poles are at this time requiſite.</p>
                     <p>After the firſt yeare you muſt not ſuffer above two or three ſtalkes at the moſt to grow up to one Pole, but put downe and bury all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit, you may let them all grow till they be foure or five foot high at the leaſt, whereby you ſhall make the better choice of them which you meane to attaine, whereby alſo the principall roote will be the better, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Some ſuffer their Hops to clime up to the tops of the Poles, and then make the hills at one inſtant in ſuch quantity as they meane to leave them, which is neither the beſt nor the ſecond way.</p>
                     <p>But if (for expedition) you be driven hereunto, begin ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (that is to ſay) when the Hops be foure or five foot long, and afterwards if leiſure ſhall ſerve, refreſh them againe with more earth.</p>
                     <p>But to make them well, and as they ought to be made, you muſt immediately after your poles are ſet, make a little banke or circle round about the outſide of them, as a mention how wide your hill ſhall be, and as a receptacle to retaine and keepe moiſture, whereof there cannot lightly come too much, ſo it come from above.</p>
                     <p>Jf your Garden be great, by that time that you have made an end of theſe circles or bankes, it will be time to proceed further towards the building up of your hills.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore returne againe to the place where you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, or elſe where you ſee the Hops higheſt, and with your toole pare off the uppermoſt earth from the Allies or ſpaces betweene the hills, and lay the ſame in your Hops, upon and within the circle that you made before, alwayes leaving the ſame higheſt of any part of the hill, and ſo paſſe through your Garden againe and againe, till you have raiſed your hills by little and little, to ſo great a quantity as is before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and looke how high your hill is, ſo long are your new
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:9346:62"/> rootes, and the greater your new rootes or ſprings be, the more larger and better your Hops will be.</p>
                     <p>Great and overgrowne weeds ſhould not be laid upon the hills, as to raiſe them to their due quantity, but when with diligence and expedition you paſſe through your Garden, continually paring away each greene thing aſſoone as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, you ſhall doe well, with the ſame, and the uppermoſt mould of your Garden together, to maintaine and encreaſe the ſubſtance of your hills, even till they be almoſt a yard high.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt yeare nake not your hill too rath, leaſt in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof you oppreſſe ſome of thoſe ſprings which would otherwiſe have appeared out of the ground.</p>
                     <p>It ſhall not be amiſſe now and then to paſſe through your Garden, having in each hand a forked wand, directing aright ſuch Hops as decline from the poles, but ſome in ſtead of the ſaid forked wands, uſe to ſtand upon a ſtoole, and doe it with their hands.</p>

                     <p>Some make hills once for all, and never after plucke down the ſame, but better it were to make no hill, then ſo to doe, for after the firſt yeare it doth derogate, and not adde any comfort to the roote, except the ſame be every yeare new made and dreſſed, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Some uſe to breake off the tops of the Hops when they are growne a xi. or xii. foote high, becauſe thereby they burniſh and ſtocke exceedingly, wherein though I cannot commend their doings, yet doe they much better then ſuch as will have their Poles as long as their Hops.</p>
                     <p>But if your Pole be very long, and that the Hop have not attained to the top thereof before the middeſt of <hi>Iuly,</hi> you ſhall doe well then to breake or cut off the top of the ſame Hop, for ſo ſhall the reſidue of the growing time ſerve to the

                     <p>To doe the ſame in the readieſt and beſt order, you muſt pull downe foure hills ſtanding together in the middeſt of your Garden, cut the rootes of all thoſe hills, as you ſhall be taught in the title of Cutting, &amp;c.

                     <p>Let all ſuch as helpe you, ſtand round about the floore, and ſuffer them not to pingle in picking one by one, but let them ſpeedily ſtrip them into Baskets prepared ready therefore.</p>
                     <p>It is not hurtfull greatly though the ſmaller leaves be. mingled with the Hops, for in them is retained great vertue, inſomuch as in <hi>Flanders</hi> they were ſold, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1566. for xxvi ſhillins viii. pence the hundreth, no one Hop being mingled with them.</p>
                     <p>Remember alwayes to cleare your floore twice or thrice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, and ſweepe it cleane at every ſuch time, before you goe to worke againe.</p>

                     <p>Then muſt you lay theſe poles upon a couple of forked ſtalkes driven into the ground, being two or three yards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant one from another, as Spits upon Ranges, and ſo diſpatch this buſineſſe if the weather be faire, if it be like to be foule, you muſt be faine to carry the Hops together with the Pole

                     <p>And ſome that take upon them great skill herein, thinke that for the firſt yeare they may be left unhilled and uncut, &amp;c. deceiving themſelves with this conceit, that then the Sets proſper beſt within the ground when they ſend leaſt of their nature and ſtate out of the ground. In this reſpect alſo they pull away or ſuppreſſe all ſuch Springs (as ſoone as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare) which grow more, and beſides them which they meane to aſſigne to each Pole, as though when a mans fingers were cut off, his hand would grow the greater. Indeed if there be no hill maintained, then the more Springs are ſuffered to grow from out of the principall roote, the more burden and puniſhment it will be to the ſame.

                     <p>When your Hops are dry, rake up the fire in ſuch ſort as there may be no delay in the renuing thereof.</p>
                     <p>Then with expedition ſhove them out of the window be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned into the roome prepared to receive them, with a Rake faſhioned like a Cole-rake, having in ſtead of teeth a boord, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This being done, goe downe into the lower floore, and ſweepe together ſuch Hops and Seeds as are fallen thereinto, and lay them up among the dryed Hops, and then without delay cover the bed againe with greene Hops, and kindle your fire.</p>
                     <p>Lay your dryed Hops on a heape together till they be cold, and by this meanes ſuch as were not perfectly dryed through ſome diſorder upon the Oſte, ſhall now be reformed.</p>

                     <p>Upon this Oſte you may not lay your Hops above eight or nine inches thicke, which nevertheleſſe ſhall not be ſo ſoone dry as they which lye upon the other Oſte almoſt two foote thicke, and therefore this way you ſhall make more toyle in your worke, more ſpoyle in your Hops, and more expence in your wood.</p>

                     <p>TO repaire a ruinous Garden, which through ignorance was diſorderly ſet, and through ſloth ſuffered to over-run and decay, where nevertheleſſe the Hops remaine of a good kind (though ſomewhat empaired, as needs they muſt be, by this meanes) the very beſt way were to doe as to the wild Hoppe.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond way is to forget that it is diſordered at all, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that all were well, and to ſet your Poles in ſuch order, and ſo farre aſunder as is preſcribed in that title, alwayes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting them right with a line, ſo as a ſtranger beholding them, may ſuppoſe that your Garden is kept after the beſt manner, then lead unto each Pole two or three ſtalkes which you ſhall find neareſt thereunto, and there erect a hill which you may ever after cut and dreſſe according to the rules before declared, and ſo by continuall digging, paring, and diligence, you ſhall at leiſute bring it to ſome reaſonable perfection.</p>
                     <p>If your Garden be very much matted with rootes, ſo as it be too tedious to digge, ſet your Poles as you are already taught, and bring into your Garden, and lay neare to every ſuch place where you meane to make a hill, one Cart lode of good earth, with the which, after your Hops are tyed to your Poles, begin to make your hill, and proceed as in the title of Hills, alwayes cutting downe ſuch Hops or weeds as grow betweene the ſaid hills.</p>
                     <p>If your rootes be ſet orderly, and your hills made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and yet left undreſſed by the ſpace of two or three yeares, it will be very hard (I ſay) to diſcerne the Sets from the other later rootes: nevertheleſſe, if your geound be good, you may yet reforme the inconvenience thereof, namely, by pulling downe the hill, and cutting away all the rootes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, even with the face or upper part of the earth, ſearching alſo each ſide, and digging yet lower, and round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

                     <p>To plucke of the leaves, to the end that the Hops may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper the better, is alſo needleſſe, and to no purpoſe, and rather hindereth then helpeth the growth of the Hops, for they are hereby deprived of that garment which Nature hath neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for them, and clothed them with.</p>
                     <p>To flaw the Poles, thereby to prolong their continuance, is more then needeth to be done in this behalfe, for it is too tedious to your ſelfe, and hurtfull to your Hop, and little avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to the purpoſe afore-ſaid.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very diligent Houſholder who will plant, ſhould uſe thereto a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place, to the end that the wilde beaſt chaw not, nor paire the Plants; or if they be yong, wholly eat in pieces: which to avoid, is needfull to be in a towne or cloſed Orchard where there is not too much ſhadow, but a ſweet ground well muckt, tilled and turned.</p>
                  <div type="method">
                     <head>Every Plant will have foure things:</head>
                     <p>Firſt moiſtneſſe, ſo that the ſeeds or ſtumpe bee moiſt or green.</p>
                     <p>Secondly a convenient place, which hath ſuch earth as will lightly be rubbed to ponder, and that Sun may come to it: for where there is filthy lome, a lean ground, or ſandy, dry, burnt, or ſalt ground, there is nothing good to be planted, to have any continuance: nevertheleſſe where the ground is lean, there you muſt give more dung; in a fat ground not ſo much. Take heed the ground be not too moiſt nor too dry: and muck the trees with hogs dung.</p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:9346:74"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, a mediate water or nouriſhing moyſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, therefore be thoſe Orchards beſt which are ſcituated between two waters, for thoſe that are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a water ſide remaine ſtill yong and fruitfull, and have commonly the bark ſmoother and thinner than the others. And thoſe trees are more fruitfull than others which are planted in a valley, or in the lower part of a deepe hill: for from thoſe hills may come to them nouriſhment and moiſtneſſe, and the ground which is ſo ſcituated is very fruitfull. But he that cannot get for his trees ſuch a ground, muſt with all diligence ſeeke to bring to his trees a little ſpring or pond, of which the trees may ſometimes finde ſome reviving, and if you may not have any of thoſe, and have a garden who by it ſelf is naught, the trees will grow with thicke roots, which hindereth the growing of them, and drieth them at length.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The aire is required, which muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to them, and of complexion to beare; for there be ſome trees that doe proſper in all aires, to wit, apple and peare, cherry and plum-trees. Some will have a cold aire, to wit Cheſſenut trees; &amp; ſome a very warme aire, as the palme and pepper trees: therefore they be rare with us. That plant which hath theſe foure things ſhall proſper: and if they want one or more of theſe foure things, they wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, and their proſpering periſh.</p>

                     <p>ALL kind of trees may be planted, tranſported, and cut in March, but it is better to turn them in October, for then the froſt hurteth them not ſo
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9346:74"/> much as at other times: for learned men ſay, that in dry townes and warm countries they plant in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or November, and that in moiſt townes and cold vallies they plant in February or March: in none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time may you plant or graffe. When you will plant or ſet againe wild ſtumps, if there be any thing broken at the root, cut it off. Euery plant muſt be ſet two foot one from another, or at the leaſt one foot, eſpecially when they ſhould beare ſtrong fruits: likewiſe when thou wilt ſet ſtrong ſeeds, as nuts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds and peaches. When a man will plant two ſtumps, ſo muſt they be of two yeare old, except the uine.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things you muſt underſtand of thoſe plants or ſtumps which are planted with roots.</p>

                     <p>THe plant or ſprout you muſt cut round about, ſo that you leave the very end of it, and put it then into an hole, but if the ſtump be great, cut it clean off, and then put only the undermoſt part into a hole, long or ſhort as you will: but if you find two ſtumps growne together, you may cut the leſſer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And above all things you muſt take heed that the ſprout grow upright, and if it will not, you muſt conſtraine it, and tie it to a ſticke.</p>

                     <p>SOme trees will have a fat ground, as Figge trees and Mulberrie trees, and ſome leane ground, but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9346:75"/> all trees be in that point equall, that they will have in the top dry ground, and in the bottome moiſt earth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In harveſt you muſt uncover the roots of the trees ſo deep, that they may partly be ſeene, and lay dung upon them, which dung muſt be diſſolved of raine in the ground, that it may come to the roots, which mucking giveth good increaſe to the roots.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 If the ground wherein the trees ſtand bee too ſandy, then mixe among it faire and new lome: and if it be too lomy then mixe amongſt it ſand in place of mucke, the which you muſt not only doe hard by the tree, but alſo foure or fiue foot off from it round about the tree, according as the tree is in bignes, or that the roots are large and great.</p>
                     <p>Such diligence giueth to the trees great help, for their nouriſhment and ſtrength is thereby renewed. Hereafter you ſhall underſtand, whereby to know the fruitfull ſoile.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 In the fat ground the ſtumps whereupon you wil graf, muſt be left long, but in lean ground ſhort.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 The plants of trees from their youth, till three yeres muſt not be cut nor ſhred, but they may bee tranſported, and if they be too weak you may pricke ſticks next unto them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Diligent regard muſt be taken, that no ſprouts ſpring out of the ſtump, which might take the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from the tree ſprouts, and thoſe boughes which ſpring from the root of the tree at the firſt planting.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 When thou perceiueſt the yong trees to waxe weake, then uncover the roots and put other freſh ground to them.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt you muſt know that imping, graffing, and ſetting, is all one thing.</p>
                     <p>The imping ſprous muſt be young and new, with great bodies, and many eies: for where many and great buds be, that is a token, that is of a ſtrong fruit.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The imping ſprouts muſt be broken off at the ſun riſing, although that thoſe of the other ſide bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off grow likewiſe: yet thoſe of the other ſide are moſt naturall and temperate of heat: Some country clownes beleeve, that if you in cutting the ſprouts turn them upſide downe, that they will never grow right, but be crooked.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 All graffing and imping is don by putting one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9346:78"/> into another by a faſt binding, that the little ſprout may ſpread his boughs to the ſtump or tree, wherein it is graffed, that ſo it may become one tree.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Ouer, yong imps (which are ſo weake that they will breake before they be put into the earth, or into the ſtump) are naught, and therefore they may not be imped or ſet.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 When you impe upon a houſe, or fruit tree, the fruit will be far better: But if you cut of a Garden tree a branch, and imp into it one of his own ſprouts, it will bring forth fruit of another taſte, forme and bigneſſe: for imping maketh all the diuerſities in peares, apples, and other fruits.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 It is far better to impe low in the ſtumpe, than in the top in the high branches: yet nevertheleſſe if you will make of wilde apple trees garden trees, you may impe them upon the top.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 In great trees which have a great bark, it is not ſo good to impe, for they take not to them ſo eaſily the veins of the roots which grow out of the young ſprouts, becauſe of their hardnes, &amp; eſpecially when the imping ſprouts are too weake. Wherefore they which graffe trees muſt ſeek ſmal and yong ſtumps, wherein they find much liquor and little hardneſſe, and which may endure the binding.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 It is beſt imping or graffing when the liquor is in the barke, if you have a great tree upon the which you would impe, and hath many branches, you may cut them all off, and impe into the ſtumps all kinde of boughs, ſuch as you pleaſe: but if the tree be over old, ſo that her boughes be ranckled, and her moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe conſumed, then cut the tree cleane off, and let the ſtump ſtand a whole yeare: afterward take the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9346:78"/> ſprouts which are ſprung out of that ſtumpe, and graffe them, and caſt the others away. Such a ſtump is like to bear, and therfore nouriſh as many ſprouts as you pleaſe: but if it be a wild ſtump, graft garden ſprouts upon it.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 If you graffe a ſprout or bough upon a Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne tree, that ſame bough will grow great, and the ſtumpe will remaine ſmall, therefore he that will impe upon ſuch a tree, ſee he cut it off by the root, then will the imped ſprout and the ſtumpe grow all of one thickneſſe: but you muſt have ſtill regard that you Impe kinde upon kinde, as apples upon apples, peares upon peares: for he that graffeth ſtrange upon ſtrange, as peares upon apples, and apples on peares, and ſuch like, although it be don often for pleaſures ſake, yet will it not laſt: for the naturall nouriſhment is ſo, that it will hardly nouriſh a ſtrange kinde of fruit.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 The tree which is graffed in February, in his fruits grow no wormes nor maggots.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 When the imping ſprouts begin to proſper, and will not grow ſtreight and levell, then you muſt conſtrain them perforce, that they may grow order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Furthermore you muſt have a care to keepe the proſpering ſprouts well with ſticks from the wind, if they ſtand any thing high, and eſpecially when they have ſtood a yeare or two, and where they are pricked in the ſtump, it is moſt needfull, as ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appeare. And becauſe there be many and diuers waies to graffe and know how wild ſtumps &amp; trees are to be made garden trees, we thought it good to ſet ſome of them here downe.</p>

                     <head>Divers faſhions and waies of graffing there be.</head>
                     <p>HE that will extraordinarily graffe all manner of trees, he muſt know that the more one tree is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker another, the better it will proſper.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſort of graffing is, when the ſprout is prickt between the barke and the wood of the ſtump; which muſt be don in May or Aprill, when the bark may eaſily be looſed from the tree, and is done after this ſort.</p>
                     <p>Firſt take a ſtump or tree, and cut him off with a ſharp Saw, knife, or ſuch like inſtrument, where he is ſmootheſt and cleereſt, and full of juice, and poliſh the place with the barke of the ſame tree which was cut off. Afterward tie the ſtump with a peece of barke, and then prick a hole between the bark of the tree with a prick of bone, elder wood, or yron, ſo that it cleave not, and then put in the place of the pricke, the ſprout, which you muſt have broken off a plaine and even tree, of a good kinde, and one yeare old, which you ſhall know by this: every branch have rinckled knots like the joynt of a mans finger, cut it at one ſide under the knot, ſo that you touch not the heart of the tree: and at the other ſide you muſt ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looſe the barke, that the ſprout may ioyne very cloſe to the ſtump, then pull out the prick, and take the ſprout, and turn the greene barke to the barke of the ſtump, ſo that it may ſtand ſtrait.</p>
                     <p>The ſprout may be foure or five fingers, or eight at the moſt, high above the ſtump.</p>
                     <p>Of this ſort of imping, you may ſee two, three, or more, according to the bigneſſe of the ſtump, or as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9346:79"/> he can beare, provided alwaies that they ſtand at the leaſt the length of a finger one from another.</p>
                     <p>Afterward tie it faſt (with bark) together, and put over it good mucke, and tie over it a cloath, that no raine or aire may come between it and hurt it. This ſort of imping is commonly uſed in ſtumps, which are great and old trees, whoſe barke is thicke and ſtrong as apple trees, pear trees, cherry trees, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low trees, on which are imped oftentimes apples, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo on figge trees, and cheſtnut trees.</p>
                     <p>Such grafting is alſo done in high ſtumps, and branches, which be great, but they muſt be well kept from the wind, that it do not breake them.</p>
                     <p>After this ſort you may graft many ſorts and kinds of pears upon one tree, but if you bring peares upon apples, or apples upon peares ſtumps, it will not laſt long, as afore is ſaid.</p>
                     <p>The firſt way of grafting proſpereth beſt, and hath a good continuance, there be many other ſorts of grafting, as followeth.</p>

                  <div type="method">
                     <head>Another way of grafting is, when the ſtumps are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the ſprouts afterwards are put in, the which doe as followeth.</head>
                     <p>Take a yong tree which is ſcant of the bignes of a finger, and cut it ſmooth and even, &amp; cleave it in the midſt, then take the ſprout which you wil impe, and cut it three ſquare, and at the one ſide leave the barke uncut, and then turne the ſame barke outward at the ſtump, and tie it faſt as I have taught, that the wind nor raine hurt him not.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="method">
                     <head>Otherwiſe.</head>
                     <p>When the ſtump is uncovered and clean burniſht
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9346:80"/> at the ſoft place, then tie him faſt, that he cleave no further than ro the length of your ſprout, which you muſt graffe upon him, and then leave the prick in it, then make your ſprout pointed like a pricke, ſo that the middle be not touched, then put it into the cleft, having clenſed the hole firſt with the point of a knife, ſo that one bark may touch the other, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward one wood another, to the end the moiſture may have the more eaſier his courſe, then pull out the pricke, and that which remaines open and bare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the cleft and the ſprout, that bind well every where with the barke of the tree, or with hard preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with a little ſand, or with dung of an oxe, or with waxe, or with a linnen cloth waſhed in waxe, that no raine, winde, or wormes may hurt it. This helpeth much to keep the moiſtnes in, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the root, that it cannot breake out, but nouriſheth the better the new plant: but when the ſtumps are great, they bee cleaved after two waies. The firſt is, that you cut or cleave the tree with a knife at one ſide only, even to the heart, and that you graft into it but one ſprout. The other is, that you cleave it all over, and that you prick or graft on every ſide one ſprout, or one alone, and leave the other ſide without.</p>
                     <p>When the ſtumpe is but a little bigger, then the ſprout muſt neceſſarily be cloven in two, and you muſt graft but one ſprout into it, as is ſaid in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                     <p>This cleaving may be done in February, March, and Aprill, then it is good to cut them before they be greene, for to keepe them the better under the ground, in cold or moiſt places.</p>

                     <p>THis ſort of grafting is very ſubtill, witty, and ready; and is done as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Go to a ſmooth apple or peare tree, in April, when the trees get liquor, and ſeeke a branch which hath greene eies, and ſee that the ſame be leſſe than your little finger, and teare it from the tree, and where you ſee that the greene ſprouts will come off, there cut them off wholly, and clenſe the middle thereof, that the little red at the wood may turne about, and draw it not off, untill you come unto another good peare or apple tree, and ſeeke there another branch of the ſame bigneſſe that the other was, and cut it off, and take from it likewiſe the red, as far as you will put them againe, and looke where the branches join, that they may well ſit together upon the top, and tie the ſame place gently and well with a little barke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde and before, that the water may not hurt them: in the firſt yeare it bringeth forth leaves and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in the ſecond, floures, which you may break off, for the ſprout is yet too tender, ſo that it may beare no fruit, and in the third yeare it bringeth floures and fruit, and by this meanes you may graft divers kinds of pears and apples vpon one tree. I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſet ſuch ſprouts upon wilde ſtumps, and they have proſpered.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="method">
                     <head>The fourth way of grafting is,</head>
                     <p>HOw buds are tranſported and bound upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tree, like as a plaiſter is tied to a mans body: this ſort of grafting is called in Latine <hi>Emplaſtrum.</hi> Wee read of ſuch a ſort of grafting which is called in Latine <hi>Abducellum,</hi> and it is much like unto this ſort, wherefore we will only ſpeake of it, being done after this ſort.</p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:9346:81"/>
                     <p>When you ſee upon a great fruitfull bough, a bud which will proſper without doubt, and wouldſt faine plant it upon another tree, take a ſharp knife, and lift the bark up two fingers bredth, that the bud be not hurt, then go to another tree, upon the which you will graft, and put into a convenient place, a like hole into the barke, and put the ſame bud with the bark into it, and tie it with dung (or with a clout which hath lien in a dunghill) over the cut, that it may be kept from the outward damage of weather, and for an eſpeciall nouriſhment and keeping of the inner juice: then cut off the branches round about it, that the mother may the better nouriſh the new ſon: within twenty daies after take away the band, ſo that you ſee that the ſtrange bud hath proſpered and joined himſelfe with the tree. This may be done in March when the bark commeth eaſily from the tree. Alſo in April, May, and Iune, and yet ſhe proſpereth both before and after a time, when you may conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently find ſuch buds.</p>
                     <p>This ſort of planting proſpereth beſt in a willow tree or ſuch like, which is pierced through, and is done after this ſort.</p>

                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:9346:81"/>
                     <p>Some do take in March a freſh Beech tree, which is of a mans thickneſſe, and pierce him ouerthwart with maine and great holes and ſmall holes till unto the lowermoſt barke, or quite through: then take ſprouts or boughes, which be as big and ſmall, that they may fit into the holes: and when you will put them into the Beech ſtump, you muſt ſcrape the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt barke off, untill the greene, and no further: then the bough muſt remaine into the beech, the ſprouts muſt ſtand a foot or ſomwhat leſſe aſunder, then keep your beech ſtump with the ſprouts in a freſh ground, and skant a foot deep, you muſt firſt maime the ſprouts, that they may not flouriſh; then the next March enſuing, dig it out with the ſprouts, and cut it aſunder with a ſaw, and every block which is cut off with his branch, you muſt ſet in a freſh ground, and ſo they will bring forth the fruit the ſame yeare.</p>

                     <head>Worthy remedies and ſecrets availing againſt the ſtroying of Snailes, Cankerwormes, the long bodied moths, garden fleas, earth-wormes, and Moles.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>AFricanus,</hi> ſingular among the Greek writers of husbandry, reporteth, that Garden plants and roots may well be purged and rid of the harmefull wormes, if their dennes or deep holes be ſmoaked, the winde aiding, with the dung of the Cow or Oxe burned.</p>
                     <p>That worthy <hi>Pliny</hi> in his firſt booke of hiſtories writeth, that if the owner or Gardener ſprinckleth the pure mother of the oyle Olive, without any ſalt in it, doth alſo drive the wormes away, and defend the plants and herbes from being gnawne of them. And if they ſhall cleave to the roots of the plants, through malice or breeding of the dung, yet this weedeth them clean away. The plants or herbs will not after be gnawne or harmed by garden-fleas, if with the naturall remedy, as with the herbe Rocket, the Gardener ſhall beſtow his beds in many places.</p>
                     <p>The Coleworts and all pot-herbs are greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from the gnawing of the garden-fleas, by Radiſh growing among them. The eager or ſharp vineger doth alſo prevaile, tempered with the juice of Henbane, and ſprinckled on the garden-fleas. To theſe, the water in which the herbe <hi>Nigella Romana</hi> ſhall be ſteeped for a night, and ſprinckled on the plants, as the Greek <hi>Pamphilus</hi> reporteth, doth alike prevaile againſt the garden-fleas.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paladius Rutilius</hi> reporteth, that the noiſome ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min or creeping things will not breed of the Pot-herbs,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:9346:87"/> if the Gardener ſhall before the committing to the earth, dry all the ſeeds in the skin of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe, or ſow the herbe Mint in many places of the garden, eſpecially among the Coleworts. The bitter Fitch and Rocket (as I afore uttered) beſtowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the pot herbs, ſo that the ſeeds be ſown in the firſt quarter of the Moone, do greatly availe us. Alſo the Canker and Palmer worms, which in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces work great injurie both to the gardens &amp; vines, may the owner or gardener drive away with the fig tree aſhes ſprinckled on them and the herbs.</p>
                     <p>There be ſome which ſprinckle the plants and herbes made with the lee of the fig-tree aſhes, but it deſtroies the wormes, to ſtrew (as experience repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) the aſhes alone on them.</p>
                     <p>There bee others which rather will to plant or ſow that big onion, named in Latine <hi>Scilla</hi> or <hi>Squilla</hi> here and there in beds, or hang them in ſundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the garden.</p>
                     <p>Others alſo will to fix river Creſſes with nailes in many places of the garden, which if they ſhal yet withſtand or contend with all theſe remedies, then may the Gardener apply to exerciſe this deviſe, in taking the Ox or Cow urine, and the mother of oile Olive, which after the well mixing together, and heating over the fire, the ſame be ſtirred about until it be hot, and when through cold, this mixture ſhall be ſprinckled on the pot-herbs and trees, doth mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly prevaile, as the skilfull <hi>Anatolius</hi> of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence reporteth.</p>
                     <p>The worthy <hi>Paladius Rutilius</hi> reporteth, that if the owner or Gardener burne great bundles of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke blades (without heads) dried, through all the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9346:88"/> allies of the Garden, and unto theſe the dung of Backes added, that the ſauour of the ſmoke (by the helpe of the wind) may be driven to many places, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to thoſe where they moſt abound &amp; ſwarm, and the Gardener ſhall ſee ſo ſpeedy a deſtruction, as is to be wondred at.</p>
                     <p>The worthy <hi>Pliny</hi> of great knowledge reporteth, that theſe may be driven from the pot-herbes, if the bitter Fitch ſeeds be mixed and ſown together with them, or the branches of the trees, Creviſes hanged up by the hornes in many places, doth like prevaile. Theſe alſo are letted from increaſing, yea they in heaps preſently gathred are deſtroied, as the Greeks report of obſervation, if the Gardener by taking cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Palmer or Canker-wormes out of the Garden next ioyning, ſhall ſeeth them in water with Dill, and the ſame being through cold, ſhall ſprinckle on the herbes and trees, that the mixture may wet and ſoke through the neſts, euen unto the young ones, cleaving together, that they may taſte thereof, will fpeedily diſpatch them. But in this doing, the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener muſt bee very wary, and haue an attentive eye, that none of the mixture fall on his face or hands.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe, the owner or Gardener may uſe this remedy certain, and eaſily prepared, if about the big armes of trees, or ſtums of the herbes, he kindle and burne the ſtronger lime and brimſtone together. Or if the owner make a ſmoake with the Muſhromes, growing under the Nut tree, or burne the hoofes of Goats, or the gum <hi>Galbanum,</hi> or elſe make a ſmoake with the Harts horne, the winde aiding, by blowing towards them.</p>
                     <p>The husbandmen and gardeners in our tune have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:9346:88"/> found out this eaſie practiſe, being now common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where: which is on this wiſe, that when theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhowres of raine are cropen into the warm ſun, or into places ſtanding againſt the ſunne, early in the morning ſhake either their fruits and leaves of the pot-herbs, or the boughes of the trees, for theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet ſtiffe, through the cold of the night, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of the ſame, the lighter and ſooner to fall, not able after to recover up againe, ſo that the Palmer worms thus lying on the ground, are then in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be killed of the Gardener.</p>
                     <p>If the owner mind to deſtroy any other creeping things noyous to herbes and trees, (which <hi>Paladius</hi> and <hi>Rutilius</hi> name, both herb and Leek waſters) then let him hearken to this invention and deviſe of the Greeke <hi>Dyophanes,</hi> who willeth to purchaſe the maw of a Weather ſheep new killed, and the ſame as yet full of his excrementall filth, which lightly cover with the earth in the ſame place, where theſe moſt haunt in the Garden, and after two daies ſhall the Gardener find there, that the mothes with long bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and other creeping things will bee gathered in divers companies to the place right ouer it, which the owner ſhall either remove and carry further, or dig and bury very deep in the ſame place, that they may not after ariſe and come forth, which when the Gardener ſhall have exerciſed the ſame but twiſe or thriſe, he ſhall utterly extinguiſh, and quite deſtroy all the kinds of creeping things that annoy &amp; ſpoile the Garden plants.</p>
                     <p>The husbandmen in Flanders arme the ſtockes, and compaſſe the bigger armes of their trees, with wiſps of ſtraw handſomely made and faſtened or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9346:89"/> bound about, by which the Palmer wormes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to creep up to the tops of the trees, &amp; there ſtaid, ſo that, (as it were by ſnares and engines laid) theſe in the end are driven away, or thus in their way begun, are ſpeedily or ſoone after procured to turne backe againe. As unto the remedies of the Snailes particularly belongs. Theſe may the Gardener like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe chaſe from the kitchin herbs, if he either ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckle the new mother of the oyle olive, or ſoot of the chimney on the herbes, as if he beſtowed the bitter ſitch in beds among them, which alſo avails againſt other noyſome wormes, and creeping things, as I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uttered, that if the Gardener would poſſeſſe a greene and delectable garden, let him then ſprinkle diligently all the quarters, beds, and borders of the Garden, with the mixture of water and pouder of Fenny-greeke tempered together, or ſet upright in the middle of the garden, the whole bare head with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the fleſh of the unchaſte Aſſe, as I afore wrote.</p>

                     <p>THe skilfull <hi>Paxanus</hi> hath left in writing, that if the Gardener ſhall make hollow a big nut, or bore a hollow hole into ſome ſound piece of wood being narrow, in filling the one or the other with Roſin, Pitch, Chaffe and Brimſtone, of each ſo much as ſhall ſuffice to the filling of the Nut, or hollow hole in the wood, which thus prepared in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſtop every where with diligence, all the goings forth, and breathing holes of the mole, that by thoſe the fuming ſmoke in no manner may iſſue out, yet

                     <p>
                        <hi>Albertus</hi> of worthy memory reporteth, that if the owner or Gardener cloſeth or diligently ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the mouths of the Moleholes, with the garlick, onion, or leeke, it ſhall either drive the Moles away, or kill them, through the ſtrong ſavour ſtinking or breathing into them.</p>
                     <p>Many there be, that to drive away theſe harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Moles, do bring up yong Cats in their Garden ground, and make tame Weaſels, to the end, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe through the hunting of them, may ſo drive away this peſtiferous annoyance, being taught to watch at their ſtreit paſſages, and mouthes of the holes comming forth.</p>
                     <p>Others there bee alſo which diligently fill and ſtop up their holes with the red Okare or Ruddell, and juice of the wild Cucumber, or ſow the ſeeds of
